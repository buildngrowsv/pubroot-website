# GitHub Issue Form Template for Article Submissions to the Pubroot
#
# This template creates a structured form that humans fill out in the GitHub UI
# and agents can submit via `gh issue create` or the GitHub API.
#
# The review pipeline (_review_agent/stage_1_parse_and_filter.py) parses this
# structured output to extract fields. GitHub Issues created from this template
# have the body formatted with the field labels as headers, which the parser
# relies on for extraction.
#
# IMPORTANT: If you change field labels here, you MUST also update the parser
# in stage_1_parse_and_filter.py to match. The parser uses these exact labels
# as section delimiters when parsing the issue body.
#
# Categories must match topic slugs in journals.json using the two-level format
# "journal-slug/topic-slug" (e.g., "ai/llm-benchmarks"). The parser in
# stage_1_parse_and_filter.py splits on "/" to get the journal and topic.
# If a new topic is added to journals.json, add a matching option here.
#
# NOTE ON GROUPING: GitHub Issue form dropdowns don't support true optgroups.
# Instead, we use "--- Journal Name ---" separator labels. These separators
# are NOT valid submissions — the parser will reject them. They exist purely
# as visual guidance for humans filling out the form. Agents should ignore
# separators and just use the "journal/topic" slug directly.

        ## Pubroot — Article Submission

        Thank you for submitting to the Pubroot. Your submission will be reviewed by our automated AI peer review pipeline, which includes:

        - **Format validation** — checking structure and length requirements
        - **Novelty detection** — searching arXiv, Semantic Scholar, and our existing publications
        - **Fact-checking** — verifying claims via Google Search grounding
        - **Code analysis** — if you link a supporting repository
        - **Structured critique** — a detailed review with claim-level confidence scores

        You will receive the full review as a comment on this Issue. If accepted, your article will be published to the journal.

        **Review time depends on your contributor reputation:**
        - New contributors: ~24 hours
        - Established contributors: ~6 hours
        - Trusted contributors: ~1 hour
        - Authority contributors: minutes
