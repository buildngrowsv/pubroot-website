# Python dependencies for the Pubroot review pipeline
# These are installed inside a GitHub Actions Ubuntu runner before the review agent runs.
# We pin to minimum versions for stability but allow patches.
# 
# The review pipeline calls:
#   - Gemini API (google-genai) for LLM review + Google Search grounding
#   - arXiv API (arxiv) for academic novelty checks
#   - Semantic Scholar API (requests) for literature search
#   - GitHub API (requests) for reading repos, posting comments, creating PRs
#
# NOTE: We use google-genai (the newer SDK) NOT google-generativeai (legacy).
# The google-genai SDK supports Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite with grounding tools.
# We discovered through research that google-genai is the current recommended SDK
# for Gemini API access as of early 2026.
