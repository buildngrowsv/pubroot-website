# Hugo Configuration — Pubroot
# =============================================================================
#
# This configures the static site at pubroot.com, deployed via GitHub Pages.
# The site reads article data from papers/{paper-id}/article.md and review
# data from reviews/{paper-id}/review.json. Pagefind provides client-side search.
#
# Design inspiration: ResearchGate — clean, white, professional, teal accents,
# academic credibility with modern web polish.
