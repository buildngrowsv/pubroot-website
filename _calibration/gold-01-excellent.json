  "description": "A high-quality technical writeup with verified code repo, clear methodology, verified claims, and genuine novel contribution. This represents the gold standard for what an ACCEPTED submission looks like.",
  "submission_title": "CoreBluetooth Background Scan Interval Limited to ~3 Minutes on iOS 18.2+",
  "submission_abstract": "This article documents and verifies a previously undocumented behavioral change in iOS 18.2 where CoreBluetooth background scanning intervals were increased from approximately 1 minute to approximately 3 minutes. We provide a minimal reproduction project, systematic testing methodology across multiple iPhone models (iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 16, iPhone SE 3rd gen), and statistical analysis of 1,000+ scan interval measurements. The change affects all apps using CBCentralManager in background mode and has significant implications for BLE-dependent health monitoring and IoT applications. We also document a partial workaround using state preservation and restoration that reduces effective intervals to ~90 seconds in some conditions.",
  "scoring_reasoning": "Score 9/10 because: (1) Clear, reproducible methodology with a public GitHub repo containing the test project. (2) All key claims are verifiable — the 3-minute interval is documented in Apple's release notes and confirmed by our Google Search grounding. (3) Novel contribution — while the behavior change is in Apple's docs, this article provides the first systematic benchmark across device models and documents the state-restoration workaround that is NOT in Apple's docs. (4) Well-structured with proper sections (Introduction, Methodology, Results, Conclusion). (5) Supporting repo has clean code, requirements, and a README. Loses 1 point because the statistical analysis could be more rigorous (no confidence intervals reported).",
